# Competency matrix 

 
This is a roadmap for software engineers, that can guide and point them into right direction with their development.  
Also this matrix should help when trying to understand current skillset of the developer.    
Important to note, that it's not some strict list of items, but rather a set of areas, where we would expect a developer to show some particular level of knowledge.
